# Visual Reinforcement Audiometry (VRA) Box

This device can be used to assess the hearing thresholds of young children (age 10 months to 2 years) and special populations.

Portable.  Half-size. 3D-printed.  Open Source.

The device's main purpose is to visually reinforce a child's behavior when they hear a sound. 
Specifically, an audiologist will play a pure tone, the child will look around for the source of this pure tone, 
and then the VRA box will flash on to reinforce their "looking" behavior. 
Every time the pure tone sounds again, the child will look around, 
as they have been conditioned to respond due to the interesting VRA box. 
Repeat until the threshold of hearing for different frequencies is acquired.

Steps in building the device:

1) Download and 3D print all 10 files (9 needed, 1 optional piece).  Use 20% infil when printing all pieces, ensure supports are activated everywhere for all pieces.
2) Buy/ gather necessary items listed in the "parts list". Amazon links are provided.
3) Download the arduino code (Titled VRA_Arduino_Code_May_24_2018).
4) Follow the Youtube build tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Vv1RhaNMnM
